An introductory project on Cisco Packet Tracer taken from: https://gurutechnetworks.otombenard.com/assetsProject/project1

Requirements:
Design a network in  Cisco Packet Tracer to connects ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
1) Each department should contain at least two PCs.
2) Appropriate number of  switches and  routers should be used in the network.
3) Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
4) All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
5) Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.

Technologies Implemented
